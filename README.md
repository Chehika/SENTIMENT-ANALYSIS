# Sentiment analysis using NLP

## overview

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using basic NLP techniques to classify review texts as positive, negative, or neutral. It uses a small dataset of 100 textual reviews , processes then with TF-IDF vectorization, and applies a Logistic Regression model for classification. The goal is to demonstrate how textual data can be converted into actionable insights through machine learning.

## Tools Used 

This project makes use of several popular python libraries and tools in the data science and machine learning ecosystem:

Python: the primary programming language used for implementation.

Pandas: for data loading ,cleaning, and manipulation.

Scikit-learn: used for TF-IDF vectorization , model traning, splitting the dataset , and evaluating performance.

Matplotlib: to visualize prediction distributions using bar graph.

Google colab: an interactive cloud-based python environment to execute the notebook without any local setup.

## Task Description:

TF-IDF Vectorization: the raw review text is converted into numerical form using term frequency-inverse document fequency(TF-IDF)vectorization , which captures the importance of words in the text.

Model  Training: a logistic regression model is trained using 80% of the dataset , while the remaining 20% is used to test model's performance.

Evaluation and Visualization: the model is evaluated using classification metrics like precision ,recall, and F1-score.A horizontal bar chart is plotted to visualize the predicted sentiment distribution for betterr interprebility.

## Real World Applications:

Customer feedback analysis: Automatically analyze customer reviews to assess satisfation levels and product performance.

Social media monitoring: track and categorize public sentiment about brands, events, or public figures in real time.

Product development: use sentiment data to identify common pain points or highlight product strengths.

Market resarch: understand consumer perception during the launch of a new service or products.

Content moderation: help detect offensive or harmful content in user-genrated reviews or comments.

## Conclusion 

This project presents a simple yet functional approach to sentiment analysis using classic NLP tools. While no manual text preprocessing was applied, the TF-IDF technique was effective in converting raw text into numerical
features for model training. Logistic Rgression proved to be a quick and efficient classifier for this task.
